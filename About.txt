	Hey, this is mBowers here. If you have any questions or comments about
this little program, drop me a line at mbowers@blazenet.net or ICQ me at 55315571.

	It took me a couple months but I FINDLY found the way to convert X,Y,Z to X,Y,
as used in this Starfield. And I was disappointed in its simplicity. :\ Ah well, no to
learn raycasting! :)
